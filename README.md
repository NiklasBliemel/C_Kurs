# Solutions: C/C++ Course - University of Regensburg

I present my solutions to the C/C++ course from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Regensburg from April 2025. <br/>
As my final project I implemented a basic tensor analysis library and a multidimensional QR - decomposition.

In the project folder there is a MAKEFILE to generate QR.exe <br/>
This program on its own demonstrates the QR decomposition on a Rank 3 Tensor, however when given the path to a .bin file, storing a Tensor Object, it will perform QR decomposition on the given tensor, saving the results in two additional files.s
